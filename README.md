# trmnl-plugin-metrofresh-soups

An Express service that fetches the daily soup menu from MetroFresh via Menuat.

I built this because Iâ€™m a big fan of [MetroFresh](https://metrofreshatl.com), a local restaurant that updates its soup offerings daily. This plugin lets my [TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com/) automatically show me what soups are available each day.

## Features

- Fetches daily soup menu from Menuat
- Returns formatted JSON with soup details
- Includes dietary information (GF, V, VG, DF, EF, NF)
- Filters out hidden or empty soup entries

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

For development with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will run on port 3000 by default. You can change this by setting the `PORT` environment variable.
